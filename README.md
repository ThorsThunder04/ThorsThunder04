## Hey there!

I'm currently a CS student studying in university.

I like to do various kinds of random projects. Though they aren't always super useful. But experience is experience.

### Programming Languages I know
- Python
- C
- Java
- OCaml
- PHP
- Javascript (I also know HTML and CSS)
- SQL
- Bash (though I wouldn't say I'm much good at it)

### Real languages I know
- English
- French
- So so little Spanish (despite my 7 years of doing it in school)
