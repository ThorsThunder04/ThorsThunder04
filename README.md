# HEYA

I'm a CS student who studies in France. I LOOOOOVE movies and doing photography. 

I often make small little programming project that just do whatever. Often something to do with image processing or automation. I don't always add everything to github. But I'm trying to do that from now on.

Here's an image I made with one of my latest projects, MOSAIC!!!

Some of the programming languages I am most familiar with is Python, C and javascript (and Java, but mostly just working with the OOP side).
I know other languages too of course, since there's loads of them in my courses. But I don't use them too much elsewhere.

I quite like my anonomity. Of course I can't keep it clean forever, but I try to avoid having my online life link back to my personal private life. Unless I do it on purpose.

## OH YEAH! MOVIES!
I love them so much. I have seen so many. A couple years ago I started tracking every movie I have ever watch, and compiled them to a list on IMDB. I chose IMDB because I can download the list as a CSV file afterwards.

Anyway, here's the link to my [watched list](https://www.imdb.com/list/ls525888441/?ref_=uspf_t_4&sort=list_order%2Cdesc). I have seen AT LEAST that many movies. Ofc there are the occational movies I forget I watched, or that I just haven't found the name to yet. But when I do, I add them to this list.
